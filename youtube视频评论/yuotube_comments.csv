#35万#"This video was immediately flagged for ""Ad suitability."" I wonder why. Surely it isn't because it's YouTube being shown in a poor light? Surely not."
#22万#Get em king! Sorry you’ve had to deal with all of this. It’s exhausting trying to guess how youtube will handle content these days
@doubleflores8350#3196#This guy got it right. And YouTube silenced him for it. Meanwhile Sssniperwolf doxed Jacksfilm and they continue to praise her. That goes show how messed up YouTube is.
@SBG2462#3293#Every month, this video is aging very well. The favoritism part especially, seriously one of YouTube's favored creators Sssniperwolf doxxed Jacksfilms just for giving valid constructive feedback for reacting to TikTok content plus she is freebooting said TikTok videos, and she's still on this platform, even though she rightfully does NOT belong here.
#7443#YouTube invited me to the Black Creators Fund and I’m Asian  they dunno what they doing for real
@indominuswrex9465#5717#Markiplier is fully aware of the privilege his channel has, frequently calls YT out for the favoritism and bullshit they give him vs other creators, and also frequently leverages that favoritism in favor of mistreated creators. So I'm sure he's totally fine with you mentioning him especially as respectfully and logically as you did.
@flarestriker2005#1982#Came back to this and Cory is still right, look at how Youtube is treating SSSniperWolf after she doxxed Jacksfilms.
@exodust3114#2149#It seems time and time again Corey is more and more right
@MultiFlame11#4771#US$10.00 if youtube had a strong competitor then maybe they would actually listen to the community and start fixing their shit
#1.9万#I'm sending you lots of love, Cory 
@DasOmen02#654#14 months later and we're in this shit again with a certain company lapdog. Your content rings true still
@Bladetastic#476#The Sssniperwolf doxxing situation being ignored by Youtube is making this video age like fine wine again (in terms of favoritism, not racism)
#2.1万#We stand with you brother ️
#1.8万#The fact that this is trending while making youtube look BAD is mind blowing, YouTube is so confusing at times.
@TheSuperCenaFan#258#This dude was right. The SSSnipeewolf situation has proven it
@MyVengenceEndsNow#240#Coming back here, today...  This is just as relevant now as it was when it was made...
#4.6万#I’m glad you made this video bro, youtube’s review system has been buns for a LONG time with no communication to the people who took time to create the content..it’s almost a guessing game on what you “did wrong” to get it restricted. I really hope they aren’t targeting you specifically for being black and it’s more of the youtube system being horribly flawed which can be fixed with better systems in place, but i’m with you all the way and got your back, I’m sorry this is happening to you
#5万#and people ask me why im genuinely worried about doing facecam videos... took a lot of guts uploading this! Appreciate you speaking out.
@thelawman8966#361#Cory your 100% right, youtube picks favorites like a certain creator(SSSniperwolf) and bends the rules for them. Shameful youtube Shameful!
@AYoungAdultOnYoutube#142#The fact this aged like fine wine after Sniperwolf not only doxxed jacksfilms with YouTube just demonitizing her, saying Jack was also in the wrong, but making a tweet that was like “would it be meta to make a reaction vid of a reaction vid” clearly shows that YouTube has favoritism for certain creators. Hell, even Woozie from GTA San Andreas sees this from a mile away
@dailydoseofpills6192#1万#It’s really painful that someone like Cory can be targeted this easily.
#2.8万#This is the type of shit I’ve been dealing with and I’ve had your same thoughts. THANK YOU for calling them out.
@deathspikeatv3182#96#The sniperwolf situation made this video age like fine wine.
#215#This aged well
#1万#So sorry you had to deal with this :( There definitely is something going on that YT isn't telling it's creators. They 100% play favoritism. I hope everything get's sorted out <3
#1.9万#This is unacceptable. I hope YouTube addresses this publicly.
@DarkAttackYT#131#One year later, nothing has changed for Youtube. They are literally siding with SSSniperWolf over JacksFilms. Instead of actually deplatforming her, they demonitized her channel ONLY temporarily  and considered Jack to be on the wrong as well, even though all he did was pointing out that SniperWolf was stealing content and making fake reactions.
@CouragelessOne#56#"""History doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme"""
#2.3万#Props for not being scared to speak your mind, we need more content creators to be honest about how they feel about these issues with these platforms 
#6558#The industry treats “certain” people like this all the time and it’s just sad.  Hope it works out for you Cory 
@dwillkapalt8555#105#This aged incredibly well
@GusTheRedYoshi#88#Even today he keeps getting proven right
@almightyloaf6223#8962#The fact berleezy got his channel terminated upon similar circumstances, further proves Cory’s point
#3478#respect for calling this out. because most creators would either be too afraid to rock the boat or too tired to try and fight back
@mastermoye3915#110#The ONLY reason why I’m watching this is because of the trending of the Sssniperwolf doxxing incident. And the words you are speaking about out on the favoritism part tells me one thing of this:
@naohaotingala6433#85#Worst thing is that Cory is probably one of the more family friendly youtubers on this platform
#1.3万#"I've been speaking about this recently & always get attacked for trying to ""victimize myself"" & videos like this proves everything I've been fighting against. If someone THIS SIZE can go thru something like this still, there is definitely a problem. Sorry you gotta go thru this OG."
#9412#Thank you so much for validating how a LOT of us felt but could never actually prove.
@kenmoops7547#90#This video will continue to be relevant for the coming years. It had to be said, Cory! 
@Hi-cm1cj#53#Aged like wine. Cory never misses!
#1.5万#Nothing but RESPECT bro!
#1.9万#It's unfortunate, I mean Cory had a problem with YouTube last time after he came back to the platform, and here we are again, you really deserve better and we're always on your side
@CryoM3ncer#157#Years later, and this video has aged like a fine wine. YouTube seems to only care about their bags of money and not for the people who make their app possible. Also, I wonder why they never suggest this video to me or my friends despite us watching your videos. 
@WyldJ#94#"Not gonna lie i literally jumped when Cory yelled FAKE and i gripped my phone and said ""GODDAMN RIGHT IT IS"" much love and respect for you Cory️️️"
#9806#Racism is everywhere, especially corporate. Appreciate you speaking your truth Cory. 
#7850#Respect to you for speaking up Cory, this has been a problem in traditional entertainment/new media/social media for too long. Someone of your caliber & the rest of us who aspire to create should all be treated fairly/equally and given a proper chance to grow. 
@user-mp2xl9vx9i#49#It's actually crazy how well this video aged. I mean... I believed it from the start but damn, the whole ssniperwolf deal just solidified it a thousand fold
@RedFormanOG#48#The sniperwhore situation is bringing alot of eyes to this video for the first time, me included! Well fucking said 
#4422#Its okay to get emotional while discussing topics like this because it shouldn't still be an issue.. I'm glad you spoke about it because this definitely needed to be said.
#3.5万#I've always felt that there is favoritism involved.  The trending page for instance is curated by human beings, not AI.  There's too much human manipulation involved.  I hope you get to the bottom of this!
@KravenSpider#40#This video continues to age beautifully
@nickcortez7083#37#Who's here after sssniperwolf got away with doxxing. 
@dinonuggets2083#5192#cory, you have LITERALLY started a chain of multiple youtubers speaking out on similar issues. im so proud of u for speaking up on this coz it isn’t easy man. everyone supports u, even people that don’t watch your content. i hope youtube responds to this issue publicly.
#2751#US$5.00 Cory is literally one of the most wholesome creators on this platform. This is actually so dumb and frustrating. There needs to be more communication and transparency between YouTube and the creators, and there needs to be more fairness. You don't deserve this, Cory.
@tsunpie#38#ok, they've proved cory's point with SSSniperwolf, this aged so well
@baileyfaith0533#29#It is so gratifying to see people finding this video in wake of the SSSniperwolf situation
#5421#As a fellow Black Creator, I agree with this 100%. God Bless you Cory. Stay strong.
#3565#This was so hard to watch. YouTube is so fucked up. I really hope shit starts to change soon. We all have your back Cory!
@LocalDude7382#39#The people who are from that twitter post about this vid aging well ️
@Reallizardking#39#And now YouTubes favoriting SSSniperwolf, absolutely nothing has changed
@dylanwilliams2386#2117#Youtube's worst nightmare, a content creator who knows their shit.
@ohyaz8#2593#Cory is literally THE MOST unproblematic person on this platform. He posts his videos, minds his business, and goes about his day. This really goes to show how the world hasn’t changed at all. Everything Cory has he built up from the ground himself, I've watched him for 7 years. He not only worked super hard for everything he has to this day, but he rightfully deserves all he has earned and more.
@Armorion#32#Favoritism being proven once again as they BLAME JACKSFILMS for him being Doxxed by SSsniperwolf and give her a slap on the wrist with a temporary demonetization.
@shqip_sumejja#24#This video will remain relevant for ages
#1.1万#I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with all of this man, wishing you the best. I hope YouTube gets there stuff sorted smh - love you bro 
@THEFLYBOYWAY#3358#US$10.00 Man listen I appreciate  you bringing  this to light.. as a black creator I felt this in the heart .. NOT Inclusive is what I call it .. but if you look at history it isn't inclusive either .. 
@xerxes4real#54#Who's back here because of SSSniperWolf
@somethingaboutguns#42#YouTube is further proving Cory and other YouTubers who called them out right after the situation with ssniperwolf and jacksfilms. YouTube is a plague of a platform with shady practices behind it. W Cory.
@XevenYT143#3431#Cory is the LEAST problematic YouTuber on this website. So definitely something fishy is going on behind the scenes.
@NoodleGoblin#2201#The dumbest decision YT could make would be to antagonize this legend any further.
@Balongers69#24#Well this aged like Fine wine after the SSSniperWolf stuff
@Waitwha#80#This video has aged like fine wine with the SSSniperwolf situation
@fattasyy#1743#I'm glad that a large BLACK content creator is finally speaking up. Youtube has been unfair for a LONG time.
@kuma316#3563#US$9.99 You tell ‘em Cory! We’ll support you through all your endeavors, because you are someone who’ll help change this world for the better.
@tylerredforge5563#25#This video is aging like fine wine
@_horrorgaloreee#35#Lmao the sssniperwolf situation just proved your point, youtube is shit at taking accountability for the users they allow on their platform, but will gladly punish the people who don't deserve it 
@isabelcranepath2410#3331#"glad this is #1 on trending. you’re winning, cory. knowing mark, he’ll probably call YT out too."
@quill3355#2882#Cory is absolutely right about the favoritism thing. They had Shane Dawson in the spotlight for so long even when he was called out for being absolutely disgusting, yet they kept him on recommended and all that other shit bc he's affiliated with youtube 
@goldenjackr57#22#this aged like fine wine
@tc6028#16#Cory, my 11 year old son has watched you for the last two years. Your channel is one out of FIVE, I let him watch. We loved seeing you in the FNAF movie, he was totally stoked. It’s important for my son to see his image out here on this platform. I stand behind you. I understand your frustrations, because I’ve seen this happen to others I am subscribed to. They often leave and go to Patreon when they shouldn’t have to.
@Pgs.99#8640#This is sad, this shouldn't happen to anyone, sorry this happened to you Cory.
@thatguy575#2053#This is so sad because CoryxKenshin is by far one of the most family friendly content creator's on Youtube and watching you get screwed over like this is really aggravating to watch.
@dripplaflare3356#20#This video aged so gracefully 
@marcusrimson6330#27#This video aged perfectly, their favoritism knows no bounds
#9483#Thank you for bringing this to light, when reviewers are given so much power without accountability, it is not difficult to imagine some might inject their personal biases into their decision making process. I understand this is a difficult job to do, and sometimes mistakes could be made without malice. 
@flurmple5587#2856#This is outrageous. Keep being truthful and speaking out Cory, all of the samurai are behind you. The fact this got flagged right away is just even further disrespect on their part.
@M8X0#18#The video continues to age like fine wine, especially with the whole sssniperwolf situation
@prettypoetic#21#Nah, I agree with you. That's exactly how it comes off, YouTube. Give this man his flowers and stop ruining a great thing for us viewers. Cory, you are amazing for advocating for yourself, addressing it immediately and following up with them. Congrats on 17.5 MILL <3
@mbn.8832#2049#This is sad because Cory is actually a good person and YouTube is making him seem like he’s a bad guy
#1775#Hey Cory my videos are constantly getting age restricted, and I feel it’s because I’m being myself (black). I censor well, and always make sure things are taken care of, but it still happens. My channel is suffering because of it, and it sucks. I’m with you brother 
@JimC607#17#All the recent developments reminded me of this video. You hit the nail on the head, man. There's just something so disgusting about nepotism/favoritism.
@Azuraichii#17#Yeah it's as clear as day with the Sniperwolf situation
@lightuplegend#3714#What's even worse for YouTube, Is that they've left Markipliers restricted, and unrestricted Cory's, to try and not make it look like racism didn't play a factor, even though this is making it look even more suspicious. Great video Cory and I hope youtube gets their shit together, I'm sorry to hear that you've had to go through this.
@theedemigawd#1774#Small black creators have been saying this for years, hopefully Cory bringing this up on his platform will get the right change we need about this type of negligence
@RealKingOfEngland#13#This has become so relevant with the recent SWolf shambles!
@akhsandro2385#16#Now, with the sssniperwolf situation, it just makes the video age like fine wine.
#1872#So much respect for you doing this Cory. I'm literally having these exact same issues and I feel like YT is just trying to do what they can to sweep it under the rug. It pisses me off.  It's not right bro.
@Rahimi001#2664#CA$5.00 It takes courage to post something like this, and Youtube should be held accountable for it. Love the work you put out dude, keep it up man!
@therealbarbiana1794#119#Coming back to this video a year later and Cory is still right about YouTube having favorites. This video aged like FINE WINE.  SSniperWolf doxxed JJacksFilms because he was giving constructive critism on her videos for not giving credits to the creators. SSniperWolf was exposed for doing other shit too like being racist, transphobic, body shamed certain body types, has been arrested in the past for disorderly conduct and armed robbery, she ghosted a dying child, and she showed very disgusting behavior towards children. With all that SSniperWolf did, YouTube just gave her a slap on the wrist and said that both JJacksFilms and SSniperWolf were in the wrong. 
@mediamech#18#This aged like fine wine
#852#Finally someone big is talking about this. Thank. YOU!!!!!!! This been happening to me all month. I was reacting to videos everyone else was and I was the only getting one age restricted
@angelbrock3106#2335#US$49.99 Your fans will always have your back! Spooky Scary Sundays for life. Thank you, Cory for all of the positivity you share and if you ever have to change platforms because YouTube wants to be jerks, you have at least one fan who will still samurai slash that like button. Much love!
#1988#Absolutely sucks to see this happen, but I want to thank you for speaking out as YouTube’s reviewing system holds many of us over with little to no explanation and is 100% worthy of criticism. ESPECIALLY in your experience 
#2272#Finally someone said it. This demands a response. If there is none, I will truly have lost faith for the last time in the business I always dreamt of working for. But this? This big? This can't possibly be ignored.
@AdrianGuzmanOfficial#12#Came here after the Sssniperwolf situation...and boy this video is just like wine as people say, it just ages better  with time  Youtube just keeps proving this man right
#1801#sorry you had to go through this Cory. This is disgusting and it's sad that it really had to take some one calling them out for favouritism before they actually decided to look into it. respect to you for speaking up for every other POC on Yt.
@PilloTheStar#15#Came back to this vid after youtube's lack of action with the sssniperwolf/jacksfilms situation. They truly do 100% pick favorites.
@bingusemperor6463#11#Watching this after SSSniperwolf vs Jacksfilms is one more confirmation for favouritism
#1912#I’m glad big creators are talking about this! I talked about this in my newest video, as I’ve been denied my play button for a community strike I’ve had for OVER 3 years (for reacting to a video still up and monetized on other YouTube channels, might I add). The double standards and constant pressure to make viral content or have your performance suffer has really affected my motivation to make content
@PastaObesity#1771#CoryxKenshin is and continues to be a legend. Now he's speaking out about this. Absolute king.
@OrbyStormy420#2#So sorry you've been going through this. You've become one of my favorite creators recently, so much respect speaking up about this 🥹 Your channel & you as a whole deserve so much better than how the folks shadowing this platform have treated you. Take care, stay safe and hydrated!
@andrewdieter9180#1206#US$50.00 For being one of my favorite youtubers, top 3, for all I've seen you go through, your growth. I can't believe I can actually see him react like this, these accusations are out of hand. I wish you the best Cory and I hope you don't happen retiring.
@flchick1103#3483#Cory doesn’t deserve to get treated this way by YouTube, their lucky to even have amazing people like him on platform.
@tysimpso1448#10#Coming back to this because of the Sniperwolf thing going on. This video is aging like fine wine man.
@RevolverCunaguaro#18#This video has sadly aged like wine
#1967#I find myself slowly losing faith and trust in the YouTube platform the more I see this happen to my favourite creators. Where would YouTube be without creators like Cory? Perhaps it should be up to the individual advertiser to decide which channels and types of content they want their ads to show up on? An advertiser would have to be pretty dumb not to display their ads on Cory's videos because they always get a lot of views and engagement and his channel has cultivated one of the best communities on the platform.
@Ronachan69#17#this aged like fine wine...
@Lumiere20#10#coming back because of sniperwolf drama and you really couldn't be more right
@GGsquared#2964#YouTube needs to realize that without their creators, they are nothing. Even if they’re a monopoly right now, their terrible treatment of creators is going to come back to bite them in the ass eventually if they never change their ways. Thank you for speaking out about this.
@Mako_456#2965#The fact they removed the age restriction AGAIN after this was posted is more damning. Im sorry that you have to go through this cory stay strong shogun
@pandabear6550#3341#it’s not fair how popular berleezy is yet he still is treated like this. cory was proven right once again but dw eezy gang won’t let youtube win!!!
@iloveeatingass#13#Despite this happening a good year ago, this still pisses me off the fact that it even happened in the first place.
@MotionlessBottle#16#Fine Wine
@1lizq#1697#I'll never leave cory's side, I'm staying with him till the end.
@thebloodycrow364#14#This video aged like fine wine.
@MiniMC546#2668#YouTube is just exposing themselves because of this. Ludwig, Charlie (MoistCritical), and now Jacksepticeye has addressed the issue and they agree with you. And since Mark is getting mentioned here, he's probably making a video to address it. He's addressed YouTube's problem before and was even given a strike because of it. The moment Mark says something and will probably be pissed throughout YouTube's policy team.
@aakashpathak1870#17#YouTube’s light punishment towards SssniperWolf’s channel after she literally committed a crime fully proves the “favouritism” part.
@lds8fcad#8#This has been going on for a long time. I’m glad he has to the time to say something. I’m really getting sick of them hiding videos and controlling who sees what. I miss the old YouTube
@egyptian_noob#1095#The ironic thing is that Cory is one of the most family-friendly kid-friendly gamer on the platform
@StielOcampo#16#ssniperwolf has left the chat
@Leafy_Animations#3866#I honestly understand why he takes so many breaks because when he comes back he has to deal with this type of stuff. keep up the great work cory!
@fruitloops2058#15#A year later and he's still right.  Sad it's been this way, at least some relief here
@Rfrancis06#1515#Cory is literally family friendly and a good man, this is not a coincidence.
#1788#It takes alot to step up like this, Cory we will support you all the way!
@ssilent8202#13#SSSniperwolf moment
@Kaleigh.12#2805#I can see why Cory takes so many breaks now, having to deal with things like this with your own job can be stressful
@2ooo5#1534#"cory this ""rant"" was extremely logical. you came through with receipts, and stacked evidence on them. we believe you and we see whats going on"
@yummythicc2D#10#I come back to this video and holy shit it just gets more right
@LimitlessZspeed#13#With the current situation between Jacksfilms & SSSniperwolf, YouTube is currently Proving everything in this Video is completely True.
#1749#I've always felt this way towards YouTube that some content creator that aren't minority get pushed more than those other who are. Despite my views are low now I'm not saying this because of that because I've clearly gotten multiple videos with over 1m views. YouTube is just a business as everything else is and they can do what they want because its their platform. Maybe they will do different from now forward having a major content creator that is a minority speak up.
@cheatemperor8583#10#This video keeps aging like wine
@JojoSmacks#11#Came back to this video in light of sssniperwolf, cory never misses
#1507#I've experienced this for a long time as well. Thank you for making this video Cory you're not alone.
@aoikuma2337#1256#In all my eight years of watching Cory, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him so upset. For shame YouTube. You somehow managed to upset one of the chillest people on your platform.
@Swarming-Languendo#11#This Aged like a Fine Wine

@lrodneysonthe161#2354#It’s genuinely scary to see Cory THIS SERIOUS and when he said “FAKE” that is 13 YEARS of HARD WORK that has been delivered by that word…. I’m actually suspicious of YouTube now they doing something wrong and it’s on purpose has to be… Cory has done nothing but put all his energy and glory into videos to entertain 14 Million people YouTube had a huge downfall
@DrewskiGames24#10#Aged like fine wine.

#2783#I’m so sorry to hear you’re having to deal with this. Well done for speaking out! It’s an important topic to talk about and I really hope YouTube sorts this out. These questions NEED answering
@HarleyKimon#9#Youtube is playing favorites again️
@Maifromnowhere#17#Twitter brought me back here lol unbelievable that she got away with doxing someone.
@yasou7577#1140#US$1.99 The fact that they immediately flagged this is just proving your point more. YouTube has been doing you dirty for a long time now and I’ve seen it with a couple other poc YouTubers as well. Who woulda thought ️ Keep doing you Cory, love you and your videos.
@mitchelldouglas2483#2014#Dude this video has gotten so many different creators to speak about this situation. Just to show the power of stepping out and voicing your opinion.
@pieseldatches#10#Everyday, this video keeps aging well. Especially after the SSSniperwolf doxxxing Jacksfilms situation.
@vaporwave_sun1171#9#Came back to watch this because of the current situation and remembered how Berleezy’s channel got deleted so quick made my blood boil
@E_qulz#1874#Cory doesn’t deserve all of this drama  he’s just a normal guy no one deserves racism or anything.
@missjesley2528#1162#It is DEFINITELY favoritism. Shane Dawson is a prime example. He was in the spotlight for so long racking in millions of views while his racist black face videos were still up. But nooo let’s take action on CORYS years old video from 2019 instead….
@trevordennisyay#9#Coming back to this in the height of the sssniperwolf situation, yeah he was spitting
@MjBeastOG#14#Cory was right by mile ahem sniperwolf ahem YouTube dont care AHEM sorry guys my throat i meant to say The Sniperwolf and YouTube playing favorites
@thewebstergaming5805#1731#Months later, Cory proved his point since Berleezy's channel is now gone ️
@pinknpc#809#Cory you’re so right. I’m just now realizing how they “segregate” black creators. That black voices platform/spotlight isn’t enough. It’s mockery.

I never had to worry about my son watching Cory's videos. He's been a great role model for the kids and I'm really sorry this is happening. We will continue to support him 100%!
@jonjonbourne#895#Cory literally is so family friendly, never curses I can literally watch his videos around my little sister because of how chill his videos are. It’s actually so insane seeing this and hope this has some sort of impact because it’s just plain wrong.
@brianbourgeon2014#9#The fact that this video continues to age well as time goes on…
@spike5609#11#And the favoritism continues with sssniperwolf lmao this is unbelievable
@BreydoF#1745#Number one trending again, let’s hope nothing shady happens this time. Stay strong Cory.️
@Gamemaster13000#1561#"One of awful things about experiencing racism is that it's not always in your face and blatant like you see on Social Media. IRL racism tends to be subtle and keeps you guessing ""Is that guy treating me poorly because he's racist or is he just an asshole and I'm being paranoid?"" It's one thing to call someone an asshole, calling someone a racist is a serious claim."
@Cheese1tsProductions#10#What confuses me is if Cory gets more views, they get more money. Isn’t that how that works? I do feel bad for Cory. One of the best YouTubers on the platform dealing with this.
@stephran#12#This is still true to this day. Youtube showed high fsvoritism by not punishing sniperwolf for literally doxxing. She just got a slap on the wrist
@AceSteakson#1621#US$1.99 Cory, im so sorry this has been happening on this platform that is honestly becoming more of a laughing stock everyday. It truly is awful what YouTube has become.
@Odessakruah#1751#Now that this is number one trending, they’ll do one of two things: 1. Take down Cory’s next video 2. Realize that they’ve been caught and try to justify themselves  ——————————————————
@TheSpaghettGamer#13#He is still right about YouTube like seriously like the Sssnipwolf drama really prove his point because they only give her slap on the wrist for doxing Jacksfilms and she is still using YouTube as a currency like she should been terminated but yet YouTube is picking favorites and let her go Scot free but meanwhile they still punish the other creators who don't deserve it and this why I don't want to upload anymore because of YouTube favoritism.
@ximenamontes8194#7#Came hereafter youtube's + sssniperwol's horrible apology. Should have came sooner, such a good video, and so important even a WHOLE YEAR apart!!!
@TealTunic#655#"""With no creators, there is no Youtube."" - CoryxKenshin"
@MavraTealSun#1553#It is definitely ridiculous. Knowing Mark's character, he will commend you for what you did and he will make a video yet again calling out YouTube on it's unfairness. He will not say or think that you threw him under the bus, Cory. He would agree with you on the situation.
@e.2526#10#This didn’t just age like wine, it aged like the best wine you can think of
@MBdynamoBostik#20#Cory is right again and again
@iamme01#831#“They got caught, with their pants down.”  i love you Cory, keep standing up for whats right.
@HeisenbergTheFirst#1866#Stay strong cory, you always have been and the YouTube situation right now is crazy.
@lilduckling9978#8#this video hits even harder now
@NEON69420#11#the SSSniperwolf stuff is even more proof
@comet4592#1349#They literally cant do anything to him because he's so family friendly and overall the perfect youtuber. hes appropriate for all ages and still entertaining which can be a challenge for some people
@moniquecaravaggi7912#1121#Cory, My kids watch you all the time and I do not have a problem with it because there is no cursing or any foul language or disrespect going on in any way.  My daughter showed me this video when I got home today, and as a mom, I am very proud of you for standing up for yourself, especially since you did nothing wrong. You explained everything in a very respectful way with all the evidence, on the very channel that is targeting you. These kids respect you and will stand behind you. I would like to point out something that you may have already thought of and just did not mention. You are an unwavering Christian that is a top Gamer. Being Christian might also be something that YouTube is not fond of. 1 Peter 4:14 ....If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.  We Pray for positive results!!
@Aneuo#9#The sssniperwolf situation is just bringing this video more into the light.
@MexicanSpy#10#This video has aged like wine
@alessa6477#1204#and the fact that the third time they age restricted it .. they finally told you why… this is crazy and i respect you cory for confronting youtube about it. i also find it crazy that they really took a video from 2019 just to find something on you  it’s giving petty behavior.
@day1185#1214#US$5.00 This is honestly really upsetting to hear. I expected more from YouTube. I'm so glad Cory spoke out about this so more people can know. This has got to get fixed. We have GOT to get to the bottom of this. YouTube review system is kinda garbage but it's not THIS garbage
@MBdynamoBostik#7#This video is getting more and more relatable time and time again.
@seannaseebarran-ou2ml#20#Honestly seeing Cory this frustrating makes me so angry,cause hes such a funny and nice person, but just seeing him mad makes me mad as well.
@StatiXW0#744#The fact that Cory didnt even smile... Shows how serious he is
@Wheredid_Tylergo#902#Cory has suffered so much throughout his career, and he still keeps going through everything. Now that’s what I call a content creator
@BuddyPlot#7#Can't wait for the sequel
@amishplumber9850#3#You know how YouTube is Samurai. You keep on impacting people positively. Me and my kids watch you and love your content. I feel your frustration.
#545#Damn Cory, throw it down! YouTube needs to take this seriously and make some major changes to their policies and the people enacting these restrictions
#992#Cory, I just wanna say that you’re my absolute favorite content creator and as an African American myself who’s dealt with racism it’s such a good thing to have you making content like this about YouTube. If they won’t listen to you, they won’t listen to anyone.
@Saavys#3#Commenting for the algorithm. Great video that is much needed for the community.
@liampettis5559#1#Cory, you are always the best at making videos. Your videos always make my day!
@callsign.naga31#805#Cory: uploads an innocent video  YouTube: “I cannot let this slide. IVE GOT TO RATIO THIS-“
@pgmonkeh2166#401#Cory, know that you have literally 14 million people on your back supporting you.  We ain’t letting this slide.
@lowreslean#7#This video is probably gonna be the best aged video in YouTube history.
@jamesgiles4517#7#This hits hard after SSniperwof
@alexhb12333#1602#Even if youtube was fully self-serving, they would move heaven and earth to keep a family-friendly 14mil creator happy. Cory is literally the ideal YouTuber they could ask for.
#747#Wow! I used to have a lot of problems with age restrictions on my channel the bigger it got but I cussed and pushed the limits, but CORY! Cory ALWAYS keeps his videos family friendly! There is deff something going on and I’m glad Cory is exposing it! 
@Leeloo_the_fox#8#your video has aged like a fine wine.
@Videogamelover58#8#Video keeps aging better and better
#1069#This is the exact issue I am dealing with, the exact same game, and same vague response about it violating community guidelines without specifying what part or issue violated anything. YouTube policies or the team that handles it need to change. This is unacceptable.
@lydiarobinson2300#1593#"The fact this has only been out for a few hours, and you can already look up ""racism and favoritism"" and videos pop up of other black (and other) youtubers that have gone/are going through the same thing, what funny is this has happened mulipity times and no one was brave enough to stand up, until now, and now you see others inspired to stand up and come out! This is a lesson to everyone, ALWAYS stand up for what YOU believe in!!! Thank you Cory for bringing this from the dark to the light!"
@smt7667##It's gonna be alright Cory you got this brotha don't let things like this drag you down you've been successful regardless don't be letting people like YT hold away from the blessings of your dreams your blessed my dude we gotcha back
@tearrencegerhard7696#12#"Honestly hearing cory scream ""fake"" sent chills down my back, he usually doesn't raise his voice but you can definitely tell how serious he is about the situation"
@cherlytemple2037#736#Racism on any platform is NEVER going away no matter how much we would like to erase it from this planet. You hit the nail on the head and you dealt with this like a boss! As Kevin Hart would say...they weren't ready for you Cory!
@fungus_jj#917#But it’s the fact that Cory then feels the need to apologise when he gets frustrated and angry. There’s no need to apologise. This is a situation where anger is 100% justified. I’m so over this and I’m so sorry it keeps happening.
@doggedsam42-75#8#Boy this video just ages better and better doesn’t it
@Vincent-cm3mp#1#Man I'm so sorry cory you deserve better you are literally in like my top 3 youtubers of all time and you are so family friendly you do not deserve this but props to you for sticking this to them you the king my shogun  Also if they hide you from ys or something we will all like go to war
@splatteredwithink#858#the favoritism is starting to get ridiculous, and honestly YouTube is just trying not to get caught with that at this point. stay strong Cory, hopefully this situation doesn’t happen again.
@julytvdz1134#879#The fact that he started an ENTIRE chain full of multiple youtubers dealing with similar situations is amazing. We stand by you cory.
@jeffdelaughter9508##Humanity is often evil....continue to keep doing great work. Continue to speak out against injustice.people of all color enjoy your content and will continue to support you

@bungaldo4676##respect to you cory, i think you're the polite-ish youtube gamer rather than the others, you make all ages can see your youtube
#1187#Thanks for speaking on this!!! They are definitely showing favoritism!!
@GigaByte-od6rv#416#Bro Cory speaking STRAIGHT TRUTH rn... Don’t be discouraged bro, the Samurai will always stick by your side and keep moving forward with you even in the face of adversity.
@mono_mono_bear#13#This aged like whine
@Kiki-pu8gr#1#I’m a late commenter, but I am so sorry your dealing with this massive injustice, you are a hard worker with very difficult circumstances and life that many people don’t know, however YouTube often places rules that is too restrictive and unfair and immediately try and cover it up and that’s unfair to everyone, Dear Cory!! We viewers appreciate your hard work and you deserve better, you’re a real man for even going to admit and accept punishment if you ever really break rules and that makes you the better person in many ways! I myself deal with racism and sexism in my life and you inspire me to fight their words and actions and make myself the better person, thank you Cory and I hope you feel important and equal because you are
@aidan_ish2447#612#I feel so bad for Corey. He doesn’t even swear or anything dirty and he’s getting bullied by YouTube. This is something else man 
#543#Boy do I know this feeling!!!!!!!!! Try working 80 plus hours on each video and this happens. Pay attention to white animators vs black animators.
@CRPit#8#We face this situation once again.
@TheRealThanos55#8#I'm African. Icreated a channel for the first time, i got 1.6k views in about 3-4 hours. It got deleted while I had not violated any of the community policies without even having any warnings. They rejected my appeal and I created 3 more similar channels and they've all been deleted in under 24 hours. I swear I have not violated any of the guidelines and they won't tell me what I did wrong. I feel that there are some very evil humans behind youtube and this is pure discrimination.
@MrMarshmelloBoi#817#Thanks for taking the time to talk about this. So proud of you!
@cozychris4915#1265#I can see why Cory takes those breaks. this drains so much youtube hasn't been the same and it shows. good on you for speaking not just for you but for all creators of color.
@wolvesden3659#1#Its not just you King . Most Ethnic YouTuber have to deal with this. I know because i have family that are big YouTuber that do family stuff and have to appeal almost every single video. It needs to be spoken about and corrected. We really need our own platform. Thats the only way they do things equally when you affect their money
@popria.#7#this video be ageing like fine wine in sssniperwolf's situation cause youtube is just being unfair at this point. Sssniperwolf is basically the golden child so their protecting her, favouritism.
@Forbillion#561#US$9.99 Thanks for having the courage to speak out, Been a fan for a very long time
@lunerkittydemon63#513#I hate that in the face of being treated unfairly, He's still expected to be calm cool and collected. Having to mute your emotions to be taken seriously is a very subtle evil.
@SaintGoku69420#7#To This Day...This Videos proves YouTube is Racism and Favoritism...And they are playing favouritism with sssniperwolf.
@alexwoogie462#8#aged greatly
@SpellboundWolf#1386#Ever since Google bought this website, it has steadily gone downhill... faster and faster into just absolute crap. I've been around since 2006. I've seen a lot of the bad stuff that's happened. It's so awful & I'm worried when (not if) it becomes too chaotic & the website implodes on itself. I don't want that to happen. I want this website to continue because I love to use it. The people and music I listen to EVERYDAY keeps me company & helps me through my chronic depression.
@Ehh0.0#1488#I watch Ann Reardon... she points out a LOT of Youtube double standards. Keep going Cory, You've been my favorite youtuber for like, 5 years, and I see your reason. You don't just throw around the word racist. You waited until it was just too annoying. Speak your voice, you've helped so many people, myself included. One of the only youtubers I can actually watch a gameplay of and not get bored, while also being meaningful and deep. Never stop being yourself!!
@cancledacc#19#And youtube keeps fucking doing it
@MegaOwy123#6#It’s sad to have to come back to this.
@MrKiwi88#667#US$1.99 We are so sorry Cory! We can’t let YouTube be like this and just get away with it! We have to do something about it! Thank you for putting up the courage to post this video and letting us know!

@mrmemester6813#2781#Cory 100% doesn’t deserve this at all, YouTube are literally being pillocks. Cory is an amazing YouTuber and YouTube needs to get their acts straight!!
@uwumarii#460#Please dont remove this Cory. You are our only voice since I've never seen a big youtuber call out youtube regarding this unethical problem
@IwebafaBlog#1#Exactly! You’ve said it all bro. Sadly it's the world we find ourselves
@MechaG2001#8#Who came here from the whole thing with Sniperwolf?
@FaunaFable#1439#I'm so proud of you, man. YouTube is supremely f*cked up. I'm so sorry they're doing this to you and to other POC creators. You have every right to be fed up. This has been going on long enough. The fact that they would pick on you and age restrict / flag / take down your content is insane to me; your channel and community bring such a light to YouTube. Your videos can be enjoyed by EVERYONE. There's no other explanation in my eyes other than blatant racism and favoritism.
#890#a similar thing happened back in 2019 when my Doki Doki Literature Club video got age restricted, then completely taken down. after an appeal, they also handed me a community guidelines strike. i would've been completely fine with the decision if it was consistent with other videos of a similar nature that got taken down, but at the time, I was the only one that got hit with an actual community guidelines strike for the video.
@Noname-ud4he#9#This aged like the finest of all wine
@bizgivbiz#3#Found this on Twitter immediately liked and will share
@briannavaladez5790#1014#"I really do hope Mark does see this. He's very outspoken about these types of situations. The more content creators talk about this, the better chance it won't happen to someone else. Nonetheless, I am sorry you're experiencing this Cory. Big companies love to describe themselves as ""diverse"" but everyone knows its just for publicity."
#643#I understand Cory so much I feel the same way as a black creator, keep your head up I see the frustration for real and I can so relate to this! We get low balled so much and never see a day of light I work 16 hours a day and it's crazy
@TheLionInTheNorth##Respect Cory, you handled it well. It is because you are chosen brother I'm proud and happy that you took a stand for yourself good for you! cheers brother!
@doreenmongake8663##Im so sorry what your going through stay strong samurai 
#994#YouTube’s issues run deep and I hope they at least acknowledge it publicly, although that’s still probably expecting too much
@ravennicole7213#866#IT'S ABOUT TIME someone addressed this matter with no sugar coating...... it's been happening way too long and it's so obvious !!!!
@CitySlicker34#7#This video aged like a fine wine
@e.chukwurah2746#4#As a black person this is totally relatable. The part that really struck me in the video was the part when he was talking about how they will put up stuff like, putting us in the spotlight, or like, black history. Like he said it’s fake. They will praise the people of color but then totally goof it by restricting the channels, and you see all the other popular channels put up the same content, and don’t get their video taken down. Cory’s very brave for standing up for what’s right, because unfortunately this video could be taken down. It takes a lot of guts. Keep up the great content Cory, and your samurai are always there. 
@moonluvrrr3091#1069#US$4.99 really appreciate your videos. super sorry that you’re having to deal with all this. :(
@platanoman8913#737#US$1.99 Keep your head level man, it’s never easy trying to get anywhere with the disadvantages set in life for “other’s”, we love you bro, you got this
@TheHeavy8468#4#W cory for speaking out about his experience I hope YouTube gets shamed on for this I hope you are doing well now due to this experience
@verosikamayday6284#6#With all the SSSniperwolf stuff going on, this video is aging like fine wine.
@mangobee1372#929#Cory is one of the sweetest, non probabmatic youtubers. It's a shame he has to deal with this nonsense. Proud of you for speaking up!
@vesiusverabis7698#959#It is 110% favoritism especially after all the drama that happened recently between QuantumTV and TheActMan. I don't know who over at YouTube's Policy Team has their panties in a twist over certain creators, but it is terrible. Everyone deserves an equal opportunity to do well on this platform.
@Moai-bf9iz#1#Respect for this man his examples and points are true and especially the favoritism part
@sauceyreynolds#1#i support you cory you are my fav youtuber and i hope there will be better days they will be better cory stay safe
@codyguli_2#967#Honestly, at this point I'm convinced YouTube doesn't know what the hell they're doing. They play favorites with certain creators, then when people call out YouTube for their shit, YouTube tries to do a full 180 and falls flat on its face. Cory, from the bottom of my heart, I'm so sorry you have to go through this unfair treatment. Keep fighting brother, we got your back 10000% 
@AuthenticZee_#736#I'm so glad that Cory is calling out YouTube for their unfairness, they hinder our progression in any slick way they can and expect us to be appeased by mediocre apologies... I just hope that your peers and people that you've collaborated with will support you if need be!
@Joey-rl8qp##I'm sorry your going through this it really sucks I really don't think it will ever end
@TheChub151#8#This video aged so well.
@Blackeyychann#373#When Cory says he is serious, we all know there's no laughter in here. We all support you brotha! I feel it
#787#What’s funny is this is the EXACT reason me and Billeimi stopped uploading on our channel. We would have WHOLE VIDEOS taken down, demonetized, or copyrighted when it was hundreds of other people literally reacting to the same thing and still getting their videos pushed by YouTube. Ik it’s tricky when you’re dealing with the music industry but we eventually got to the point to where we just let them claim and takedown whatever because we weren’t getting paid like that anyways it was for the fans who wanted to watch us react and then freestyle over their artists songs. An it’s unfortunate because we LOVED creating content but had to eventually get “real jobs” and find other sources of income so we could SURVIVE AND PAY BILLS .
@DiegoojedaMendez#4#AN OUTRAGEOUS ACT! NO ONE MESSES WITH THE SHOGUN! THE CHOSEN ONE! 
@iam_alanaf6206#5#Coming back to this video and its still relevant is sad smh!
@boxuni8865#730#I’m glad this video was made, I didn’t even realize how many times Cory had to make a separate video directly towards YouTube to ask why? YouTube has been really sketchy in the way it takes advantage of it’s YouTubers and it’s been shown in other ways besides racism and it’s incredibly upsetting for someone who has enjoyed YouTube as way to just enjoy content from other people, but honestly being a content creator on YouTube sounds like a nightmare in many areas. :(
@TsuMxchi#357#The fact that YouTube flagged this for “Ad suitability” RIGHT AFTER the video was uploaded, yeah. That should TOTALLY fix the problem, right YouTube? Flagging someone for “ad suitability” just cause they pointed out your BS.
@ajitsreepathi8013#11#We live in a world where Cory's videos get flagged as age restricted whilst a doxxer gets extra revenue.
@hyjuguy#2#youtube been real quiet, they know youre speaking nothing but the truth shogun. Go get em!!!
@kayomai9198#677#YouTube just doesn’t deserve Cory, and yet, he stays here to continue giving more to us despite the circumstances. There isn’t much more you can ask in a content creator.
#781#At first I thought it might have been due to many more eyes on your videos while you're trending, so a lot of new viewers see your old videos too and then perhaps report them and flag them to be re-reviewed. It's ridiculous how they can go back and forth on their official decision without really giving you any reason why. I hope it's not racism or favoritism. I hope they're objective with their decisions. They're not making that obvious though. I'd LOVE to see some transparency, YouTube.
@WhizzKid2023#2#yes I understand in full I  have experienced first hand racism, as soon as my ID was verified by YouTube my views dropped dramatically instantly! so sad that this silent racism still exists in our modern society, this needs to be stopped! I am literally so upset and in sheer shock!
@blbprime11#4#This video is aging like fine wine. Our boy being proved right even a year on  He shouldn't be. But he is
@hanfathedestroyer#1024#I’ve noticed a lot of racism with YouTube especially people of color content creators.  Every single thing cory has said in this video is real and very important. Cory does not deserve all of his videos that he takes his time editing on to be taken down while everyone’s is still up. I’m glad that you decided to talk about this cory! Great job!
@glitterstudent7066#360#Please do not apologize for getting emotional. This is a part of your livelihood, you’re passionate about it. Speak out. Speak up. Make YouTube treat you fairly.
@ShenitaMoore#4#THANK YOU!! I work so hard for excellent content and my videos get NOWHERE!! I use a lot of the same tactics as other creators in my bracket, who ultimately get massive views. It’s so frustrating! 
@TheRealTechFace#4#Coryxkenshin, I've been a samurai for 5 years. I subscribed to you because your content was amazing and very entertaining. Speaking as a white male, YouTube 100% has biased opinions towards certain people. I'm not sure if it's racism (although that's exactly what it sounds like) but they shouldn't do that regardless. I'm very sorry that you are going through this. YouTube really needs to get their act together.
@DaiKaijyuu#1236#YouTube has been doing this BS for a long time, I can say that it is 100% favoritism, but honestly you make a really good case for racism being involved. I remember the situation where Markiplier called a strike on himself because someone else got a strike for doing the same thing and he felt it wasn't fair so HE went to YouTube to put a strike on HIMSELF. I can't remember the full details, but I do remember that situation happening, it is clear that some YouTubers have a leg up over others which is stupid.

@CharlesTheChosen#751#This is a hard topic and I’m on Cory’s side. Also, it’s ironic how Cory is number one on trending again, watch them age restrict ANOTHER one of his random videos 
@yumekome#511#"the fact that bro has to manage his reactions and emotions so much simply so that people cant pull the ""aggressive black man"" card on him, is awful. like it hurts to see cory have to stop himself from venting because he knows that black people's emotions are constantly used against them."
@thiccanimewives#5#This makes so much more sense now with the sssniperwolf and jacksfilms situation, they took sssniperwolf's side despite the fact that she steals content, groomed children omegle and doxxed jacksfilms, and also lied to a dying fan in 2021.
@YeetDude150DaBoi#5#I’m getting tired of YouTube Doing This Shit, It’s absolutely ridiculous that they constantly screwed you over, and honestly they’ll keep doing it, they got other people for stupid reasons and quite frankly YouTube’s gotten to a point where they’re just as stupid as TikTok, I hope every goes well for ya man, good luck .

@SadmanBarkullah02##You are always true . I am watching your video since 2016. You're my favourite youtuber from the very beginning. I love all of your videos. Once, I was searching 'Coryx Kenshin birthday' where you danced. But after scrolling for a long time. I failed to find the video. Then it broke my heart 
@vibetoast1910#6#you can definitely tell it’s favoritism considering YouTube has done nothing to sssniperwolf when she doxxed someone and she received no punishment
@extinctrat5369#1182#YouTube doesn’t deserve you Cory you deserve so much, glad everyone is supporting you cause this is just unacceptable!
@bitrxn#638#This video actually scared me, I've never seen Cory yell at the camera in a non-playful way...but he has every right to be angry about this, YouTube you need to fix yourself because this is honestly so unfair and annoying. I watched so many other people play the game and they didn't deal with this its so unfair. If YouTube age restricts or takes down another CxK video, the samurai community WILL go off.
@Sarah-ff3eo#1#Cory is a goat for this
@RealChannelChatter#3#Dude I agree with u because I’m Hispanic and when I saw this I was shocked 
@OutDated.87#402#US$4.99 Youtube is annoying. I am sorry this is happening to you. Stay strong man.
@RayRay-mn2iy#564#"Cory. I am a mother of five children who have all watched and loved your videos. I myself also enjoy them as well. This video broke my heart on so many levels. As a African American woman who experiences similar issues in my career. I applaud you for putting this issue out there. Especially the condescending means by which they ""acknowledge"" people of color. It is not just happening on You Tube but many streaming channels. My respect for you has grown tremendously young man. Keep pushing that positivity that has kept laughter in my home and keep exposing your truth. Shame on you You Tube. Disgusting"
@ndalo-entlemahlangeni#1#What you were saying about people trying to give black people the spotlight being condescending and stuff... As a black person I have seen this on social media for a long time and just could never find the right words to express it and you just described it perfectly.
@francesgarnett3496##You are an amazing creator, I love your videos. There amazing and I agree!
@Whichmftookdawwwid#857#£2.00 Sorry you have to go through this, you are literally one of the most respected creators in this platform and I have been watching your content for years.
#658#My boys been watching since this channel it was below 100k - they sent this to me and I love the pure expression. Definitely needed to be said. Thank you for sharing 
@weird-beard#6#this video aged like a fine wine
@asaturdaymorningcartoonvil3968#7#This aged well
@Fukuro0526#631#I can tell Cory is mad, frustrated, probably disappointed or sad throughout this whole video, just gonna say we love you Cory, it's good that you save your videos Cory and how you are so brave to proof infront of us, justice is served LEGENDARY SAMURAI!! we will always be there for you Cory, fight whoever treats u wrong️
@rufixlegacyproductions2001#866#The fact that Cory has pulled a uno reverse card on YouTube goes to show what their true morals and intentions are. We just had a situation not too long ago with The Act Man being demonetized.. This is a bad look for YouTube, especially in the policy department. Stay up Cory !
@DaddyDaughtergaming2023##I'm glad someone has been speaking on it, it has happened to me several times on another channel, and they did the same thing to my vids
@xokitaq#1#BRO EXACTLY. I feel so bad for all the creators that have to deal with this like I don’t know what YouTube has became nowadays like not just YouTube OTHER GAMES TOO. LIKE ROBLOX. Finally someone has called out YouTube for this W and respect to this guy Yk what ima sub also I can from the sssniperwolf and jacksfilms thingy.
@Businessman_Justin#811#US$1.99 Stay strong Cory, you handled this the right way and there’s no way this situation will end up with you & your channel being in the wrong.
@Soosss#1142#I’m down for Cory calling out the bs on youtube, he’s not wrong that every time he’s blowing up, some random BS happens.
@melrutherford9898#3#Most respected black YouTuber ever.......keep going cory and you to jack.  there are only such people like that man on earth .
@siennahoward5623#3#Damn, sorry about this Cory..I'm black too but no black youtuber i,ve ever watched has ever brought this up, glad you brought this to light.
@nursemental_7389#623#I can’t believe the NERVE youtube had to reject his appeal and then when they saw Markiplier’s part of the video they approved the appeal. That’s literally proving what Cory is saying. We send a lot of love to you Cory and hope this never happens again.
@T-Vivid-T#507#This isn't right he doesn't deserve this, he's such a loving and caring person, honestly a Saint in so many people lives, youtube is 100% in the wrong
@JoshuaDaliah#3#YouTube is killing us  Cory I subscribe and hit the notification and like the video by the way.
@RoachDoggJr5284#5#Like fine wine 
@babobobo2454#502#Cory talks about how he didn't want his emotion to take over but that's hard when this is your life, your career, and your blood, sweat, and tears are on the line. I'm not a person to rave about people and gas them up at all but Cory I will rep even to my children. His content is Christain family safe. You even get parents wanting to watch his content with their kids. For all the things Cory does to keep his channel in a certain way, why wouldn't you want a creator like him in the top spot?
@raintheapc#593#As a fellow African American myself, It's a shame to see YouTube do something like this and they have been for a while now. It's dumb because Cory does THE best he can to make his content as kid friendly as possible. It's a shame Cory has to call YouTube out on this, YouTube needs to fix this right away.
@huntersmith_ttvyt3757#1#We all stand with you Cory 
@razeyt6715##Hey Cory I love your videos so much I’ve watched your videos for the pass 2 months and by the way do more spooky scary Sunday videos just for every body And what do you want on Christmas coryxkenshin like a present
@konfusedkiwi5833#406#Like Cory said,  “One day there is gonna be a platform that’s bigger than YouTube”  I’m waiting for that day bc this is getting ridiculous. Everyone is gonna move away from this platform once there is something better. Smh. Great job for standing up Cory. We’re here for you!
@Official_Javee#952#Youtube has really gone downhill these last years, this year definetly is going to the grave. We can fight this Cory, we support you! <3
@TheUntoldSamurai#2#Much love Cory man
@saintseanw##We will stand with and for you, Cory!! 
@KROW_COMBOS#735#This is very real and pretty disappointing. Tpain even expressed his frustrations when Twitch offered him an Ambassador position for a Twitch Black. An idea they've been thinking of implementing where black creators can do their own thing. Like you said in the video, WHY?? Black creators are just as good if not better at what they do so why do they need a separate section? Look at Kai Cenat, just reached Top 3 Streamer with Rage and Bruce also following suit.
@maddogofpittsburgh#1075#Cory does not deserve any of this I can’t imagine how he must feel after all he has done to help people
@JosiahW11-oz3sm#4#Broski I understand you, even though i'm white. Therefore youtube is just wanting something that is favorable to them and not others. Spread the truth.
@Zaneypoo#1#1 year later, and god, this is still so heavy in my mind
@unfinishedcola9238#850#"I’m VERY happy this got #1 on trending. This has been happening to other creators that i watch and it’s unfair, stupid, and the creators aren’t white. There’s definitely something going on."
@ValiantSquad705#283#I honestly feel bad for Cory. I can tell he's being very serious right now because of his tone and everything, Don't worry Corey we as your fans got your back.
@kitsmith806#3#I agree with you , I don't think it's a fluke that when I read a racist comment on YouTube and I try to respond, YouTube, within the first few lines of my response, completely removes what I have typed! It happens constantly, so I can only think that YouTube allows racists to write whatever but the rest of us are not allowed to respond! It's no coincidence.
@bravebatman4915##it took me a fuuuulll on YEAR to come across this video and ive been watching you for 3 years now! thats so crazzzy. obviously thry workn against my boa. i never knew this vid existed and i always scroll thru your content. ik we cant do much but comment and complain but i can do one thing valuable as a viewer and thats only watching black people’s content. it wont do much but what it will do is keep racists from my human experience.
@smilytrash8210#409#GET THEM CORY, this is UNFAIR!!! Youtube's misdeeds need to be brought to the stage its not fair
@OneSteell#703#Tbh, I think Cory deserves better than this he puts in a lot of effort onto his amazing channel and personally I think YouTube is in the wrong on this one!
@remixedbeat9768#4#This aged better than wine
@IsaiahPadilla-fb6pq##You are wise and calm, that is why you are my favorite
@aterriblettv5923#399#US$1.99 Well said Cory. Glad you’re shining light on this. Something needs to change; having you - one of the biggest minority channels on the platform - speak out about it will set that change in motion.
@calebchan9497#402#I really REALLY FELT it when he shouted “FAKE!” Stay strong Cory, YouTube is just a pile of crap these days.
@MattBlack-zc1bl##Thank you for saying it. A person with a large channel had to do it to make it matter, at all. God bless you!!!!!!
@Viruxsx#2#You dropped this 
@Borzah#947#I’ve been shadow banned on YouTube for a year now. Used to average 200k views per video now I can barely get 10,000. YouTube’s support system is not good
@CHERRYTHEBOOM#375#Imagine how many small content creators are having the same problem but aren’t “big” enough to actually do something about it. Thanks for talking about this so publicly and honestly Cory.
@JasonMcCarley##We love you Cory and we support you and this message. Our whole fam has been watching since 2015.
@Iwishuroses#5#Sniperwolf is a great example of this 
@jbthakid5578#1285#AU$7.99 Im so shocked Cory, you don’t deserve the wag you’re getting treated. ️
@losttapes3764#410#Most social media platforms doesn’t want the POC getting big especially the TEENS and the SMALL CREATORS. We see you TikTok, We see you Youtube, We see you twitter, We see you Snapchat. We love you Cory, you should never have to go through this. Youtube don’t deserve you .
@JINCAKE123##I’m so sorry Cory that YouTube is doing this to u. I love ur videos so much and this community. I’m sad and mad. Sad that this is happening ,mad that YouTube is miss treating you.
@Cantzee#2#"Gives me them chills watching this back. Rewatching this, i understand Cory was really angry and pissed during the video. But didn't really want to show it on camera because it would make it awkward. But i totally agree what he was saying. Favoritism will always be here, and Racism. Which is very sad to say, as a majority of contect creators are Black. Cory is a veteran on YouTube, and hadn't had a controversy's throughout his whole YouTube career. And i understand why Cory would have made this video. Tbh, i don't want to lie. I watched 5 seconds of the video and immediately started writing this comment. Cory went in so deep making this video, he didn't have a script (Not that he has a script while making his videos), but actually I understand them breakes he takes. He has his own life, family and activities and hobbies that arent just YT. If YT doesnt say it, everybody else will say it, Cory inspired sooooooo much Black Content Creators, i watch Ras.V time to time, and he always says in his intros ""Shout-out to Cory-X-Keeeeeeenshin!"", always loved hearing that. <3 Cory"
@alia1915#445#It hurts to see Cory targeted like this, I hope everything gets better in the future. I’m sorry Cory this happened to you
@TheEchomaker#589#"""Scrutinized"", hit the nail on the head with that word. Its scrutiny that is a huge issue in discrimination nowadays."

@thatrandomguy362#5#this video age like wine
@Clustifle#10#It's all again and Cory was right about it again
@lydiajoi3470#413#You are a young BLACK man/creator who is a POSITIVE influence steadily getting bigger and garnering more followers. You do not swear, you are respectful of other creators and your subscribers/fans while standing strong in your humbleness, faith, and spirituality. YouTube along with many other institutional systems do not like to see this for it does not fit the stereotype of the young BLACK man. They will only allow you to be as great as they want you to. They will try to hinder your growth to limit your influence and minimize your impact. Please do not allow this to deter you, continue to stand strong and know you do not stand alone!
@bussayrolla3227#597#Sadly this is the case for a lot of things in society. Micheal Jackson said it best: “they don’t really care about us”. It’s sad that these big platforms are ran like this. Lord knows if us black people tried to make our own platforms, things would go bad. It’s just the world we live in, but all I know is that we have to stick together. Amen.
@XWBgaming#4#Came back after the SSsniperwolf Situation. YouTube definitely has favoritism
@marisanssummer8882#2#Love you and support u cory
@mrflyman4543#629#I can’t believe they be doing Cory like this after all he has done to the community and this is YouTube’s reward
@jy2Clampy920#857#Yea “youtube black” is all a backhanded reward just so they look like they are equal and respectful to all, cory the black community is right behind you and you started history and the unforgetable, we got this
@aimfire7846#6#It really shows YouTube still hasn’t changed prior to this video was uploaded. YT is doing a great job disappointing the community 
@jessicagreenfield6584#5#This video aged like wine 
@Smitchen0#420#"I've only watched Markiplier and a few other content creators but since he made the ""Try Not To Get AGE-RESTRICTED Challenge"" I was rather confused why he made the video until I read the comment section that helped me find this video. I wish I could do something to help but since YouTube is so powerful my voice isn't much. But you've earned a subscriber and a follower. Its leaders like you that state the facts that will help our future become more equal. In the words of MLK “We will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.”"
@chasegriffin2193#413#US$2.00 We appreciate you doing this Also I'm trying to spread the word to help you also samurai stand up This is our calling
@itzmatos#11#This video is aging so god damn well lol
@jeremy.paulus1##another black youtuber this happens to a shit ton is JiDion. it’s so obvious that there’s racism at play, wether subconsciously or not, it’s there. you’re amazing and keep up the amazing work!
@cloudzie1557#857#"I""m very proud of Cory. He addressed Youtube with no hesitancy about the issues and with evidence to back it up along with it. I have never seen the creator I've watched for 5 years yell the way he did. Cory I am deeply sorry that you experience these issues, and it sickens me to thinks that someone could just do that to another. We love you stay strong."
@epicplayz6132#503#YouTube just doesn't deserve Cory, and yet, he stays here to continue giving more to us despite the circumstances. There isn't much more you can ask in a content creator. 
@tinacooper4531#4#Yes you are right also when i leave a comments youtube removes my comments. also it looks like racism. But there are a lot of black people who are trying to get there own site where they don't  have to worry about youtube removing videos and people comments.
@bingo2underscores#3#evergreen video
#275#Now imagine if you’re a small creator. Keep speaking for the people fam. We got your back 
@viabee7584#382#CA$2.00 Thank you Cory for addressing this situation! We samurai believe in you, you are such an amazing person!

@itslefty7143#431#US$4.99 You never fail to make me proud, Cory. Keep doing what you’re doing big brother! You’ve always been my biggest inspiration, and I don’t think that’ll change for a long time. You have my full support.
@itzskir6832#514#"#1 on trending again ironically lol. Lets hope YouTube actually takes the time to respond and talk about this. The fact that YouTube has such difficulty to actually communicate with creators is sad. But the fact that the age restricting system seems rigged as hell is even more sad"

@Im_Laura_Jones#846#US$1.99 I’ll admit I had never heard of you before a little while ago, when I watched Jacksepticeye’s responses to the issue. Now that I’ve watched this video, I’m very appreciative to you for sharing your story…this is just a small thank you for using your voice in such a powerful way. I’m subscribing and I look forward to watching more of your content. ️

@DaRealBoogy#9#And now its sexism
@jo2293#398#I ain’t never seen Cory this mad ever. I feel bad for Cory man he ain’t do NOTHING to deserve racism and favoritism
@ChaseL16357#926#I hope that it's not just racism, but YouTube 100% plays favorites. I mean, some people are literally do crimes on their platform and YouTube protects them. Also, I don't think hitting Markiplier with this is that big of a deal. This is unfortunately not the first time something like this happened and he is the first to call YouTube out on this BS. He even told YouTube you strike down his own videos cause of this. 
@gimmymorefood9938##I completely agree with you Cory. Something needs to be done about this, the sniperwolf situation proved your point even more.
@randontimberwolf4007#3#I'm returning back to this video after what SSSniperWolf did to JacksFilms. You were right about this: some youtubers have gotten the boot for using misinformation that they would later correct themselves on. Lia committed a crime and it took youtube an entire week to respond and even then, they did nothing
@inarib-k8820#547#Cory this is an extremely important step you’re taking by using your voice I deeply admire you for this, racism is no joke and as just a big creator like yourself I’m glad you have this platform to share the things that happen through your experience. YouTube needs to do better because that’s not okay. Racism is getting so incredibly old idk how we are in 2022 and ppl are so arrogant they think their superior bc of the color of their skin glad you didn’t let this slide we are watching Cory and we see what’s happening dont let it mess with you 
@WlLKY#357#“I am deeply sorry” Cory there is absolutely nothing you should be sorry for, you’ve been building this community from the ground up for years. We’ve got your back with any decisions you make 
@miathompson208#7#Plus the situation with sssniperwolf has been taken lightly like she went to a youtubers house threating him for making content about her were as if that was any other YouTuber their channel would have been taken down or gotten a massive suspension  Be better YouTube.
@Supersayainpikmin#10#I'm amazed YouTube is still letting this video stay up because they keep proving him right constantly lmfao
@rachelle.A#454#11:00 wow this is straight facts, everytime during juneteenth or black history month when these big corporations did black empowerment things like that I always felt like something was off and that it felt fake but I could never rlly explain or articulate it. U put it in words perfectly smh. Thanks for this video Cory.
@sistah221#464#We stand with you. You are my sons favorite YouTuber. As a parent I’m comfortable with him watching you for the laughter and without the cursing as well as a black man doing positive things. I always tell him to “stand up and stand tall”. You are a true example of this. Thank you!
@nicatina#5#This video aged well. Considering what happened to Jacksfilm. There is a major concerning of classicism involved because Lia is the richest YouTuber and Jacksfilm is not that famous.
@milescantfeelhisthroat9679#3#Its freaking crazy how right he was. Everything he said rings still to this day
@YeahJustADuck#361#The fact that Youtube terminated Berleezy's channel on Black History Month is even more messed up.
@CasuallyComics#306#This video while saddening is hardly shocking. YouTube has for years preached one thing but practiced another. I was doing the church style mmmhmmms when you were talking about the YouTube Black program. 
@user-qv6zv2iu5n#5#I feel so bad for cory
@Seffyy50#2#it’s because your a good man who is a strong christian and they hate that keep your head up
@lilmissmars#1134#coming back to this masterpiece since they did Berleezy dirty. Once again the Shogun has been proven right. Im so sorry to you and all the other creators on yt that have to put up with this. You’ll always have the Samurai but I truly wish more progress could be made sooner. I hope this recent fumble with Berleezy re-ignites this conversation and brings it to the forefront. I hope allies and other creators step forward and show support in standing up against these bs “policies” and restrictions like Cory has done here.

@jadea2088#347#YouTube is unbelievable. How can they do this to a person who built his name and reputation as a content creator for all these years, before reaching all the success and popularity he has today?!

@half-pintash3056#723#Even if this did turn into a bit of a vent/rant, it's understandable. Whether it's racism or favoritism, there is absolutely some shady stuff going on here, and it's near impossible to keep emotions out of it when you're affected by it. And that's good, sometimes, because emotions are what make us actually do something about issues. 
@MakemeWantIt69#576#I totally agree with Cory, it’s always like a constant feel of “aversive racism” smhyou make great content, I Can’t imagine how many hours you but in work to edited your video for profanity and so on.. on that note keep doing your thang, you built up an amazing fan/family base with great content, funny, enjoyable commentary. The Samurai fam is here to stay️

@kjdover1102#505#Hi Cory, I wanted to let you know that this is reaching outside of your subscriber base, which is some small victory, I'm sure a lot of people who don't watch you but watch other black creators will see this. I hope that your prominence, impact and raw honesty will start real change on this platform.

@enochsibande2731#319#It’s crazy how YouTube really tries quiet voices that shine light on the true colors of their corporation no matter how big they are. I applaud you for speak out because it is risk but not only are doing a service for yourself but your doing a service for an entire community of black creators who go through the same thing with different fanbases and followings. YouTube can try to silence you but the truth will prevail regardless. 
@gameplushproductions561##everything will be alright with youtube i feel your pain dawg
@laaliyahdixon4883#3#A whole year later and yhis video is STILL valid. Especially of whats going on with Jack and Lia.
@tropicalblurr9878#420#You go Cory. The amount of creators that are treated unfairly are unacceptable. Thank you for exposing this issue.
@CousinKwan#354#Imagine being a black creator on a significantly smaller scale and having to deal with this. It’s extremely stressful and disheartening when your videos are flagged or buried with no true explanation. I’ve tried to “Quit” YouTube many times but I keep coming back because of the Love I have for creating videos. It’s honestly the most toxic relationship I’ve been in . Hopefully Cory and other black creators are able to continue to open more doors for us. YouTube might not appreciate us but WE appreciate us

@DanielKashule#507#£1.79 Cory you have done massive things for this platform and it’s such a shame to see you and other creators get mistreated just because of the possibility that you are favoured less than others. It’s just not fair man
@vboogie6026#542#We stand with you, young man. I don't watch you, but my daughter and her cousins love you, and I think you're a great talent. I watch a lot of black content creators, and they all say the same thing. From shadowbanning, to youtube unsubscribing members from certain black youtubers channels just as they are starting to do well. I've heard it all. Keep at it!!!! So sorry you're going through this, but they ran into the right one today. God bless...
@Tragicz-685#7#So Sssniperwolf is allowed to get away with doxing Jacksfilms while our BOI, THE GOAT OF ENTERTAINMENT, THE ANKLE BREAKER AND THE SHOGUN HIMSELF CORY is getting age restricted because of a scene in a game and the colour of his skin. wow Youtube y’all are something. This proves his Favouritism theory too.
@senatorarmstrong8960#4#Seeing some of the biggest names on YouTube comment in support for Cory is very heartwarming
@TwitchDXZInfinity#299#"This is #1 on trending Cory… I’m worried because it’s just a matter of time before YouTube tries to do something"
@dragon_biscuits#665#I can completely see why Cory's emotions bled into his words, it's because this is absolutely unacceptable. Even if YouTube isn't racist or playing favorites - even though I really think it's one of the two - there is no reason for them to age restrict him and not any other creator. Them backtracking and age restricting both is just a show of how far they've gone.

He has been such an inspiration to everyone that watches him.. he is such an amazing person that genuinely doesn’t deserve any of this hate from yt. He edits on his own, he produces these amazing videos on his own, and he makes all of these on his own. He works harder than more then half of these other YouTubers, and still has YouTube favoring other creators. He has helped countless people through tough times, including myself. He is funny, original, and he interacts with his audience like they’re family.. you won’t get that from very many creators. I know you probably won’t see this Cory, but I just want to say I love you, and I hope you get through this <3
@ojavan2630#339#you always explain things well cory 
@KANYEREST135#6#This video just ages better with time lmao
@UGOTTALOVELETTI#4#i know that i’m late to this video but remember when berleezy got his channel terminated because of poop killer and i’m  pretty sure other people have played that game . i know this is off topic but this is literally how i feel on my schools dress code
#341#Sheesh.  We with you . A lot of people feel this way.
@BradleytheDavis#578#it's totally possible that youtube is biased against black creators in order to make their platform more appealing in other countries where racism against certain races is more culturally accepted. it's possible this sort of racism is motivated by corporate goals. or it could be individuals that are racists working at youtube. 
@gdphantom7940#3#Decided to come back here after Sully's video on the sssniperwolf situation and yeah THIS VIDEO HAS AGED PERFECTLY
@cheetaah.##Yo i love you cory. I watched you sometimes when i was little and now i realise your great .
@supremeteen1975#297#This is an outrage. I remember YouTube being just fine in the late 2010s-2016-ish. I stand with you Cory. Evil hates the truth. YT needs a mouthful of it.
@adreyannam.8459#429#Seeing so many people saying that they have been dealing with this is so sad. Never in my life have i thought anyone would make a video like this about Youtube. I’m very grateful for you Cory, thank you for speaking on this as many others cannot. ️
@jihongmoon8799#5#agreeing comment for the algorithm
@user-ju7qs6bj1c#1#You have been my favorite YouTuber for 3 years now and I think it’s stupid how they did that to you
#646#You didn't deserve this. Hope we will hear from Youtube soon.
@chlorox01#286#The way that Cory literally screams at YouTube, calling them out on their bull, yet this video is still more professional than any of the actions YouTube has taken regarding this situation... It's pretty damning for YouTube as a company and shows how every person making these decisions for YT is just a butthurt, stubborn child. Every action YT seems to take regarding this issue just digs a deeper and deeper hole for them.
@badban_#2#just noticed listening to this for the millionth time - he hit 18 mill !
@HLSean#4#I feel bad about racism and n-word during YouTube collabs which leads to bad one and I'm not Africa nor America. I understand Cory, guess should have gone badly. Thanks bud.
@David_reactions#371#Keep your head up Cory you got this 
@just_thinkin#385#Cory doesn’t deserve this, he’s a great YouTuber.
@Ace_Maus##This video keeps getting more accurate and important by the day. Youtube is, as RTGame said, such a *Youtube*.  Also, congrats on the FNAF role! 
@EzekielBrown-pv2wo#3#9:27 my favorite sentence in this video
#273#This happens to me all the time  hope things get better. Thanks for sharing your experience
@marsadelaide4992#343#US$4.99 Cory, you are an inspiration for me, and you are one of the only YouTubers I get excited to see every time you upload. I appreciate you as a person, and I am appalled about what is happening. You addressed this in a very mature way, and you are 100% valid in your anger and disappointment. Never stop being you, and while I’m not religious, god bless you brother
@Chair3524#6#Cory is such a good guy
@alioreads4u#1#Keep doing The Lord's work Cory. He sees you; that's all that matters man.
@raltjeBOSS#458#Cory I’m on your side with this. This is unacceptable.. they need to be held accounted for this
@iiifrostyii#319#Not only does this show YouTube as being either biased or racist, it also shows that the problem is deeply rooted. Sure, one bad apple doesn’t ruin the patch, but what happens if the entire patch of apples is bad? There’s gotta be a change, and I’m glad Cory is spearheading it. Chad behavior.
@driftiguess#6#every few months this video becomes true and within this month's case its the sssniperwolf situation
@HayFatwithSurf#2#"This is genuinely sad, how does youtube even come up with the idea to do this? Let the man be #1 trending, he deserves it!"
@dawsonjones7530#309#It makes me sick to see how YouTube has been treating their creators. ESPECIALLY Cory, who remains family friendly and NEVER CURSES in his videos. As an aspiring creator on this platform, seeing how people like Cory can grind and grind and make it to the top and still be treated with disrespect from the SAME PEOPLE WHO NEED HIM ON THEIR PLATFORM just makes me think… man….
@sammya2614#376#Much respect for Cory, honestly I wouldn’t have taken this as lightly.
@MonkeyDLuffy-ls2wb#5#this video keeps aging like the finest of wines every month
@TheDiamondCore#21#Aaand sniperwolf got away with doxxing, s***al interactions with children, ghosting a terminally ill child, etc with a slap on the wrist This site sucks.
@kinsugalsaeg2955#420#Unfortunately yt has been screwing over a lot of honest creators and its slowly continuing to grow to all the big youtubers. PlaguedMoth or any true crime investigators, now even Cory the most wholesome youtuber I've come across. Seems to me like there needs to be a new platform creation.
@haileyostler7979#442#As much as I’d be interested in seeing how YouTube will respond to this, we all know they never will. Taking accountability isn’t really their thing, which sucks because this platform means so much to its creators and us viewers and they’re killing it.
@m1koe#4#this aged perfectly well
@jesserenew#1#Well at least you were able to get a lot of views, but I feel your frustrations. My experience is way worse.
@CabinetsAndCupboards#328#this is just awful, Cory doesn’t deserve this.
@knxyuchihauchiha6244#298#I love how Coryxkenshin stays calm when he talks about negative or messed up stuff keep it up coryxkenshin !!!
@SparkLabReal#6#I'm assuming it's favouritism since they just pulled the same stunt with sssniperwolf. Disgusting.
@Duckies476#1#You don't need to apologize. Youtube does though because they are favoring some really bad people right now and hating on good channels like this all because they are a different race and some might even have a different religion but no matter what i will still like this channel.
@madhattey#509#dude I'm really sorry that this happened; as an Asian Youtuber myself, I've had limited ad suitability (just RECENTLY) for videos that have been out in the open for months sometimes YEARS, sometimes copyright claimed for very old videos years ago, whenwhile there are many white youtubers(these people in question who've been accused for very horrendous acts btw) who have done crazier stuff of their videos and they suffered the bare minimum in Youtube's policy.  I'm a much smaller content creator, but this does happen to us as well and I'm honestly not shocked that favoritism could be at play. Maybe even racism if that's the case.
@noahnorder803#310#You are not alone Cory! KSI has been dealing with the same problems since 2019, something shady is definitely going on
@QuanShort##It probably because you are brave with your faith. Keep doing great posts and spreading your joy. Don’t back out of your faith.
@TheHuskyK9#4#No matter how long it’s been, this video continues to age perfectly as YouTube hasn’t changed one bit despite them feeding us empty words and hypocritical statements
@baha8754#392#That’s really messed up and no matter how much YouTube does this to you, you always find a way to keep grinding. Your amazing Cory 
@dirtkids6570#377#This is so true, everything he said. And I think we can agree Cory has all the rights to be pissed at YouTube.
@guard321#5#hey cory you were right all along sssniperwolf did some awful stuff and you tube is not taking action because she is YouTube's favorite.
@Shockwavetheanimator#6#One year later he was correct
@JordanNMusic#351#This video is so important. I remember being demonetized for having “reused content” when I reacted to movies on here and yet majority of the nonblack creators didn’t get anything removed. There’s definitely something afoot at youtube we don’t know about. I’m glad this was given a spotlight to discuss.
@Wolphcake#307#We're listening Cory, and this is something extremely  legitimate and important. You make so many amazing points in this, and I'm sure it doesn't even scratch the surface of what you feel when they do this, but as a Samurai and a devout ally I hope you understand that I and so many others are with you on this. Its unprofessional, offensive, and completely arrogant on Youtube's end to do this SEVERAL times to you and others. You are such an inspirational and wholistic voice on this platform and yet they treat you like this, its truly disappointing to see this happen to you AGAIN. But as I said, I, We, are Samurai and we are here for YOU! If Youtube has a problem with you, they have a problem with us. We love you, keep your chin high.
@pixelsaurustheking#4#Man how true this is now
@Monumentos71#4#This aged like fine wine......
@bulgeun-wihyeob#314#the really sad thing is that their racism includes favoritism too. markiplier is half-korean, but he's still a favorite. it is a god damn shame that youtube is being like this and we've seen the signs and issues a thousand times over the years. i really hope this'll be resolved eventually, for you and other creators like you. you deserve so much more than this.
@muddassir1974#293#“ They don’t care about you until you reach a certain number or point. Even then, your still just a number to them.” -Coryxkenshin
@vlogswithgigi441#4#They’ll literally get u age restricted and demonized but there’s more worse vids of girls naked on here or getting injuries dat are graphic and @youtube dosent do shi about it they don’t age restrict it or demonetize it atp YouTube is starting to be messy bc of dis generation im sorry Cory you gotta go through this ik dis was a year a ago but it was in my recommendations lmao you keep your head up king YouTube js hatin bc u blowin up betta ya subscribers got chu dats all dat matters

@TristinDaPiston#545#This is extremely fucked up!  May god bless you, Cory! You’re truly one of the most transparent YouTubers on this platform!
@user-po8wc5ql4m#289#Youtube disabled the visible dislike statistic for moments like this when we all know Youtube and this topic is getting straight ratio'd in this video. Good for you Mr.Kenshin. Don't stop expressing your creativity and we won't be going anywhere! 
@MrGrassToucher#3#With the ad block stuff and sniper wolf this is crazy aging
@kingmafia2462##Agreed bro
@hope-cat4894#288#It most likely both. I've heard about YouTube's racism problem for years with the algorithm favoring white creators. Unless you go out of your way to follow black creators, they won't recommend them even when they make the same content as white creators that you follow. The algorithm definitely notices the race of creators.
@heysirigivemeacoolnickname#285#You’re just a freaking legend Cory. No wonder you’ve taken some breaks, you are human after all. All it takes now is for YouTube to start treating you like one.
@HUNKKERD.#2#I did what you asked us to do, your like 17 millions subscribers strong, and i didn't even see you once. You're right Cory, hopefully this dies down.
@lukebarber1933#3#Nah they jealous cuz u based and they ain't, stay at em my boy
@DCGSwiftsix#313#US$4.99 Cory I’m so sad to here this I’ve seen it happen so many times and no one talks about it. It’s so messed up that this happened to you ️️️
@claytonheatherly2267#285#This honestly makes me so upset. Cory is so genuine and doesn’t do anything besides make everyone else happy. He couldn’t have said this any better and I hope he gets to the bottom of this all. It’s disgusting that YouTube is doing this.
@Kourages#4#This video aged like fine wine. Especially with all the Drama going on between @jackfilms and @sssniperwolf
@JR_X915#8#25k dislikes is insane. yall need to chill. hes spitting facts
@BadWolf1237#316#Happy to see that Youtube STILL hasn't learned their lesson. This situation, especially including Markiplier, has repeated itself so much... I completely understand your anger. Thank you for adding to this conversation. We shouldn't let them ever get away with this, especially if racism is involved.
@maydagoat999#355#11:52 you can truly tell how frusturated cory was here. From his face expressions to the sound of his voice. I hope things get better for you cory. you dont deserve this at all
@Akikyo.##It's okay cory
@armany4546##Yes get him brother samurai
@IZxyech#304#wow, just wow. I'm absolutely speechless. Cory, if you are reading this, i'd like you to know that you deserve better and thank you for speaking out about this situation
@Elegant_Sausage#488#I wish I could say everything's going to be ok Cory, but something has been wrong with youtube for a long time now and they are not interested in fixing things like this.  Someday there will be a better platform, and all your fans will follow you to it. I hope it happens soon because yt deserves to lose good creators after how they've treated you and all the other good creators.

@LonnieBhi#324#If only some of you knew that we are tested more than others, this video is just one example. Imagine someone constantly testing you, looking for faults in everything you do, & somehow this impacts where you live, how much money you make, your ability to network/make friends, etc. It can make you feel crazy, worse, it breaks your spirit & causes you to give up or have low self esteem.

@MBdynamoBostik##the fact that this video is still up proves Cory's point
@krisl6537#1#This sh*t happened to me a little while ago on a different site. I'm an author that uploads my book to a site in the chance to get professionally published  on an app. I don't hide my face behind icons so my readers and the site know I'm black. When I first started posting chapter by chapter, I got put on the recently updated page and got a really large reading fan base. But suddenly, my book stopped appearing on the main page. Reviews also put you on the main page, and whenever I got a review, I would only be on the main page for an hour while others older than mine would remain. When the book was finished, I appeared on the main page for 3 days, in which my reader count accumulated over 30k reads. The overall binge rate of my book is 98% percent and is rated 4.8 stars out of 30 reviews. Now inquiring minds want to know, why the hell has my book never been included in the popular lists, trending page, or recommended list? Yet, there's over 20 random books I have counted that are somehow on the trending page that are not only rated 3.5 stars, but they only have 35-60 likes, and also have only 5 freaking reviews? How is that more popular than a book with over 200 likes + 300 reactions and +250 comments. I get how you feel, even though you've amassed such a huge following, this is so demotivating. Must I mention, yes, most of those writers are either anonymous or let's just say not black. Sorry about the info dump but watching this video has kinda triggered me into venting.
@impaled047#2#One year ago, this video was released. YouTube still didn't fix this problem.
@ThEFLaTLiNeRsCoRNeR##Hahahaha Cory this is funny tho they haven't taken this video down do your thing my guy you make my kids laugh alot man.
@Stoneyboy28#3#the dislikes on this video is the YouTube Appeal Team.
@BKBunny5##"I think i would be funny if all of a suden cory was #1 youtuber in subs or veiws or something and youtube would just be like, ""oh well i guess he is pretty good"" . Btw cory i love you you are the best yter by far"

@EthanPlushMovieProductions#3#On a post Jacksfilms and SSSniperwolf event YouTube, this has sadly been all but confirmed.
@paranormal_poptart2815##Hey i just wanted to say this reminded me about a time i was about 12 i was about to go 2 sleep and i was freaking out cause 1 of my videos had almost 300 views and next morning i literally was so excited to see the views and i checked and it was changed to 23 views, wasn’t copyrighted or etc. just felt like saying this.

@roshu7625#2#I am on your side Cory!
@acridkey#5#That you for articulating YouTube’s abverse bias practices. You’re not paranoid. They demonetized my channel for “reusing content”, without explaining the context. They playing games.
@sadiawaqar9059#6#Im on ur side
@zaskywaker4367#14#This video aged like wine, especially after Sssniperwolf's drama
@toby9569#2#Cory you ain't wrong. What you said freedom speech but for some reason. YouTube wants to go against you. Even tho there are other bad youtube doing much worse then you. And they choose to go against you anyways. That just Messed up. Sorry what happen to you cory. There lot support for you. Never give up.
@brendanyoutube5423#1#"As a white person, I can't imagine this happening to me and a black creator. We could play record and upload the same game that deals with dark and personal things. The YouTube team would look for something in the black person's video and age restrict their video, but I would be totally fine. They would try to appeal it but it's rejected. And then they send my video to the YouTube team to show that their is possible favoritism. And they remove the age restriction from the black person's video. I would think, OK, why did it take my clip to make the YouTube team reverse the decision? And why was my video fine when their video was age restricted immediately? Then a few days later, YouTube decides, ""You know what, let's just age restrict them both for the heck of it."" I would feel just as mad as that black person is. So Cory, I may not know much about you, but you did the right thing calling YouTube out. We should all be treated equally. Us white people should not just be given favoritism. We have all of your respect for you. Keep fighting and let's hope YouTube can get there selves together."
@silashurd3597#1#This couldn’t be further from the truth. Since this year has passed, YT has really not cared at all and has been letting specific YouTubers get away with stuff they’re not supposed to do. Example: SniperWolf. She straight up DOXXED Jacksfilms because she couldn’t stand the idea of someone exposing her for literally stealing other people’s content and not giving any credit. And YouTube sold nothing and even mocked us people who were speaking out. But when they did do something. It was unsurprisingly a slap on the wrist 2 day or something demonetization. So yeah. You have been right Cory. It’s sad to see this website be like this.
@isaacstone3266##Hey cory i love how you just put yourself out there showing your opinion
@iglin06#6#1 year later and nothings changed
@kirbykw.#5#man this video was 1 year ago and youtube hasn’t changed, sad.

@platinumpowerranger7941#2#Bro Moist Critical gets to have interviews with youtube themselves to talk about the exact same problems regarding the times he got demonitized for no apparent reason. But at the end of the day, they didn't listened or they just didn't care. Youtube shows time and time again that they don't care about us. Even if we talk about this stuff, they will either ignore it or come up with some brain dead excuse to hide the fact they don't care. Youtube needs to make a change or else things are just going to get worse. Hell, a youtuber I know has stated that Youtube has flat out refused to give them their silver play button for no reason, and the only reason they haven't talked about it with youtube is because of the fear that youtube will demonitize their main channel again.

I got to strike because of that video and many other channels as worst videos than mines. You know now I'm trying to be monetized. They're asking me they want to send a video to them instead verifying blah blah, but I just think I think YouTube is racist my friend straight up and down.

@This_Is_Anime_and_Editz##I truly agree with what Cory is saying. I get treated like this sometimes but it's at school and I'm black. And a lot of people favor others or are racist and don't mind it when other people do the same thing because they're either white or something like that. I'm sorry but that's just the truth of how people are in this world. I'm not saying that I hate people like that because hate is a strong word, just that I don't like dealing with them. please don't mix up my words or change it up. please don't do that. that's all I have.

@user-zh5oc1bl6c##I completely agree YouTube has shown favouritism and racism countless times and it is so twisted and a lot of YouTube short creators don’t even get paid for there work such as master oogway and it’s honestly just terrible I hope YouTube covers this issue
@Deus_wukong1468#1#Youtube casually just recommending me this.
@nicksharkpuppet#1#Cory, this is the kind of bullshit i have to do on a daily basis. So this is one time I look on my Gmail, and one of my videos just got banned, of course I find the content and of course i’m seeing videos of people green screening the SAME FUCKING VIDEO and they have more views than me, let me? No let’s play Favorites! I bust my ass off to make these videos for people to just hate them, and not even look at them. A random kid on the Internet that doesn’t even have to try on making a video will be more successful than I would ever be. So I’m sorry this happened to your Cory I feel you.
@Aimai.37#2#I find it weirdly ironic that I found this in my recommended lmao
@GrahamBoyd-vy9oz#1#I’m sure it’s not racism (except maybe the bozo who rejected the appeal) but it’s most definitely favoritism YouTube is notorious for favoritism. I’m sorry you went through this Cory you are one of my favorite YouTubers.

@EndrVersace##Wirh the break Cory is in right now I really wouldn't be surprised this happens again when he decides to upload again.  YouTube, be better
@CelestinaakaClonaClox9999##You know, I've been thinking about this for quite a while ever since I first saw it, and I think I came up for a potential reason for all this malarkey.  I think the higher ups at YouTube just don't want to admit when they're wrong. I think they're more concerned for their self-image and/or the platform's self-image than the platform itself, to where even when something like this happens, they refuse to admit defeat or that they're wrong for the sake of YouTube's marketability or something. I don’t know, that's just my hypothesis, I don’t know if that's true or not.
@PriceSkullGames##I'm sorry for you brother
@V_haunting_in_the_comments#1#I love how Cory is trying to stay as calm as possible unlike other YouTubers
@ILEEGAL143#2#The fact that YouTube acc Flagged this video over a lame excuse AND that berleezy’s channel got terminated proves his point EXACTLY. they are also giving sssniperwolf a slap on the wrist for what she did to jacksfilms. So pissed off about this man. I’m glad this video is aging well tho
@Bonniethebunny176#2#Fr cory when People greenscreen without giving credit youtube don't Take that down... But when i make the video with the audio And give credit YOUTUBE TAKES IT DOWN AND SAYS IS COPYRIGHT LIKE OMG

I would want to keep doing hiatuses like that if I was in Cory's shoes. Every time I come back to this video, it ages better and better. I am so sorry for my man Cory having to go through this. I’m so glad that this video exists. I love you man. Hope you’re doing well. God bless you…

@Aroilt##Watching this video now. He was true all along.
@wendiix.#1#i know im super late and u might not see this comment but i won't lose faith, its posible that they are trying to do the same thing that happened to Akon to you, Akon was a musician who turned down the illumanati and his fame went to 100% to 0% at once. At the end of the day be safe out there becouse they see that ur a big creator n they are trying to bring you down (cuz ur christian and spread the word of good too) if u turn them down im sure god will bring you up no matter what. Just know the real ones stay.
@Typical-Greek#2#Why is this on my recommened page now? Is youtube trying to look equal now?
@brookelynnewebb333##Back when this was going on(about 3-5 months ago, and of course it still is but was more relevant), I talked to my mom about this. She brought up the fact that Mark's fanbase is larger than Cory's, so if YouTube went after Mark, they would be dealing with a larger fanbase. With Cory's fanbase, it's smaller than Mark's but would still have an impact.

@zirralzv1723##Cory literally has come such a long way jus for youtube to be treating him like that
@raiser_ps##Idk why I see this video for first time after a year this vid got uploaded. But now I kinda understand why Cory gets off of YouTube, not posting anything for a few months and so on
@ShiaOcasio##I’m rewatching this vid, and I still feel very bad for what happened to Cory
@user-qy3re4ui1c##I have a theory as to why this may be this way. I feel like it could have something to do with entertainment monopolies and a sort of Youtube economy issue. They probably notice that your channel is succeeding to a point where you dominate the genre at which you make content based off of. They could be artificially fixing your success so that the platform isn't dominated by a select few youtubers who usually do a specific genre. A similar thing happened when letsplay and gaming channels completely dominated Youtubes feed to the average viewer in 2013, and they had to artificially limit the probability of it popping up in someone's For-you page. They could be doing the same thing but with age-restricting as a less obvious method. Then again, this feels way too extreme to be true but I feel like it could be a possibility. ( Unless I completely butchered how Youtube's economy works)
@Watarmeloncat#1#1 year later I can confidently that YouTube has a big favouritism problem and I mean a very BIG problem
@HB_69420##Put this in the hall of fame of YouTube too
@younoticedme##I know this video happened 10 million years ago, but one thing I wanted to add is how unbelievably easy it is for people to report anything on Ytube, and Ytube take actions first, and ask questions later. Oftentimes they won't even show you what you did wrong and will not respond. At least you were able to get a call.  You just keep getting demerits for just about anything. I set myself up to where I'm double dipping, so if Ytube cut me off, I'm still good because I didn't invest totally in one platform.  I also think creators need to make sure that Ytube is not your only means of income and  that it's just a side hustle, because I see a lot of people being demonetized or having their channels taken down with little or no explanation. All this because someone reported them or some trumped up allegations. I am familiarizing myself with Rumble, because I know Ytube is shaky as heck.
@pandachopnews##I got hit with a reuse content demonetization. I proved that it wasn't valid when I appealed and they denied it. I have been in contact with customer support since then and spoke with a MANAGER and they told me reuse content is not the reason why I got demoneitzed and they don't know the reason why, can't provide me the reason why, won't do anything to find out and all I can do is wait 90 days and re-apply for monetization. It's literally the craziest thing ever.

@chuckstickmanii4373#1#I’m on your side
@pandemonium66#4#Sounds like, when you start trending you're bringing in new viewers. Likely some of those viewers are racist and report your content based on their bigoted beliefs. YouTube is probably depending on reports to monitor content. Their system flags your videos based on those racist reporters reports. Since there's no way to determine if the reason for a report is genuine and honest in it's motivation there's no real solution. In truth many YouTubers skirt the edge of the rules. They mostly get away with it unless they are a minority. YouTube should be more equal in the application of the consequences but the real problem is probably the community.

I think her main channel and also was live on it and her Instagram I believe and she did not get any restriction and she was also blatantly copied other Youtubers of reacting to people and reaction to what they do And she’s not getting copyright struck at all for anything and whatever she does or says she doesn’t get in trouble even before she used to do bad things with minors on Omegle and she never got banned so I think YouTube is just messed up and it needs to get better

@sibuncube8501##I'm coming back to this some time later but one thing I remembe; Context: I subscribe to Cory and have notifications on because the man is one of my favourites on here. But, when this video came out, I never got any word about it on my side. Didn't see it on my homepage, no notification either. The only reason I found it was because JackSepticEye made a video on the topic and referenced Cory's. So even then, YouTube still tried to blackball him and hide the video. Only reason I got to hear his voice was through a white man telling me about it, no hate to Jack of course, but the situation is jarring.

@cuzzoasian##Little did we know, this video did indeed proved correct as I heard of Berleezy's channel got terminated and the SSSniperwolf's situation.
@K.O.F.I##"They did same to me just last week, I uploaded a short about a Joke, it got removed because they said it promoted ""hate speech"" I appealed but it got rejected. But this joke and even darker ones have been made by others but not removed. Hmmmmmm"
@V_haunting_in_the_comments#1#But do you guys wanna know what’s crazy? I made a community post about this and I linked the reaction video AND this video.  So tell me why when I put the links in the comments, the link to Cory’s video keep disappearing. It took like 6 tries to get the link to actually be there 
@Kai_lil_bro_bro##that's actually kind of scary knowing that Youtube really could terminate his channel if they really wanted too.
@Tryhard-bvg123#1#If YouTube doesn’t try and explain themselves by commenting this video then I will never trust YouTube again(ofc I’ll still use it to watch CoryxKenshin)
@Nyxlic_lore#1#Does that explain why your last of us part 4 isn't available?

@user-ue4cq2lz2q##I look at this video and feel anger, disgust and dissapointment
@user-rn5uv3bj3p##4:08 Cory said damn it’s fine I forgive you
@danishhandsome1391#2#Guys I'm watching this in 2023, quite funny how it take Markiplier video to remove the age restriction, first of all they don't age restriction Markiplier video because he's famous and has a lot of views. Just like speed when he flashed at one of his live stream he didn't get banned because his famous and has a lot of views but if they did banned speed they will have lesser YouTube user that watch speed if his account is taken down. YouTube is just greedy and unfair.
@LuciidDreamerz#2#Given the amount of ads I constantly get shoved down my throat by YouTube, despite it never relating to anything I search of watch, this doesn't feel too surprising, they clearly are a pretty racist company that loves to play favorites
@ISYTACC#2#yes this is one of the reasons I quit editing because of favoritism,it’s honestly unbelievable to see editors getting 8k subscribers in the first week they join youtube while others who’ve been on here longer have way less.
@VidDO1##This has started happening to my channel and I'm New on the platform. Age restricted twice with clips from videos on YouTube that aren't age restricted and copyright strike for a Usher song playing in the back ground so I removed it, fixed the issue and re-uploaded it but now I'm getting no views
@kermitgotthesickkicks4265#5#This aged like fine wine damn. Youtube is stupid.
@Officialenamoredmedia##Bruh I’ve been thinking this for a while but when they rejected my detailed appeal today I knew they were on some nonsense! Age restricted my video when there are countless others by white creators with no restrictions absolutely insane!
@Abstract_9#1#I’m not on YouTube’s side but they would’ve age restricted this video but, they didn’t because they know Cory is right on what he’s saying with this.
@alzidanjagdeo5082##Corys right, Youtube be tripping nowadays.
@mrdoge3277#1#Youtube definitely has some favoritism when it comes to banning. Just look at sssniperwolf who commited a LITERAL CRIME and just got temporarily demonitized

@prince_k.325##this video is so unskippable
@taffybrian5940#1#Youtube is being unfair to cory because he has worked harder than the other youtubers with more subscribers
@mckaylaperdue1156##i’m not saying Cory is wrong or making up things, because i totally understand why he is upset. Another youtubers 2nd video of an 8 video series of the mortuarys assistant got age restricted. Youtube is not consistent at all, and it needs to be publicly addressed by youtube.
@abruh1289##Coryxkenshin a small one and this happened to me with a rocket league where a white person uploaded the exact same video but mines got age restriction but they did not tell me why

@botiemaster3356#2#I don't get it. Did he have a jenna marbles moment? Making videos with millions of views is basically every person's dream that is making videos on this platform. And he walks away from it.
@JeremiahDogan-ir9ch##I'm late but @youtube why
@user-ex8lx5ib5f##so make your own platform
@86Corvus##youtube is favoringminority ethnic youtubers. the truth is markiplier is on a whitelist and you are not. what restricts your annels is a BOT, there ponse that you got after appealing was alsoa  BOT. not a PERSON. a personhas  corrected he bot for a while but after a whileit e pired nd the bot restricted both videos because that vid of markiplier was taken f whitelist.

@jaydenjbryant8665##Its not because of your race stop blaming everything everyone does on the false pretense they are racist
@Brooks1874#2#Blaming racism and favouritism when he has 17 million subs? Come on dude this just ain’t it.
@Jhulvr##this dude loves playing the victim its hilarious, his video got age restricted because it had suicidal themes in it which isn't crazy to start of with, not because mans black. Second calling Youtube racist literally makes no sense, its a company, even if the video were age restricted because of his skin color that doesn't reflect on youtube at all, it was the fault of one individual, its like calling the police racist because of one bad cop. The reason all this happened in the first place was because Youtube has a crappy creator dispute resolution system, we have known this for a long time almost every creator hates Youtube and its been that way for a long time. Kinda pathetic how easily he pulls out the black card and makes a whole video whining about a little inconvenience that is preventing him to suckle all the ad revenue possible out of his video.
